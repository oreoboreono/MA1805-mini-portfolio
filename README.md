#1. Drawing

I tried to represent the feeling of being helpless and pitted against overwhelming odds. Yet, we still try to persist and survive, an effort that often seems futile and yet admirable at the same time. I made an interactive emoji with moving elements to tell a short story. The character is stuck, moments away from being shot. The panicked character shakes, watching your every move by following your mouse cursor with shaky eyes. By pressing the middle of the crosshair, you put the character out of their misery despite their pleas. While this project may come across as edgy, I feel it successfully conveys a message through its use of dark elements, which is what inspired me to create it.

#2. Movement

I created motion through an animated diagram of the rocky planets orbiting the sun. My goal was to highlight the pattern of passing years. I wanted to show how each year can feel so different and is often celebrated—l represented by a counter that spins and a cheer sound effect that plays with each passing year. However, I also wanted to contrast this with the idea that, as time passes, individual years seem inconsequential on a cosmic scale, blending into one another. One thing I discovered was the beauty of the planets' rotations, achieved through the rhythm of their spins.

#3. Multiples

This project illustrates the repetitive nature of eating. You are presented with various foods to chomp on endlessly. I tried to convey how, as you eat more and more repetitive patterns pass by, a message starts to cut through the noise. In my project, as you continue to eat, the food starts to become strange. It transitions from fruits to meat, and finally, you are literally “eating the rich,” making the message clear. This connects to the repetitive gesture of consuming media online; as you scroll, you can start to decipher the patterns in what you are watching, understand the underlying message through the repetition, and form your own opinions.

#4. Media

I created this project by combining sound and interactive video. Using webcam footage, audio, and moving interactive objects, I tried to convey my message about distraction. Media always carries cultural weight, but this project also highlights the consequences of that. Life feels more distracting than ever with rapidly advancing technologies for sharing and platforming media. I conveyed this by having the webcam feed stop, representing how life pauses when you consume media; everything else is put on hold to interact with the moving shapes and images.
